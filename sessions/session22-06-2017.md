# TODO :

## Not using parameters in the action methods of controllers : 
* Using of the object request and response setter in the construct
* Now the methods get back the parameter id with $this->request->getParam('Id');


## Refactore the methods of the controller : 
* Using of only one return my function
* Each condition set the variable $html and at the end of the method, we return it


## Delete all the requestGet and requestPost attributes : 
* Using of the object request and response setter in the construct : 
	* ex : $this->request = request and using function $this->request->getParam()
* Not parameter in the function dispatch. We have to use directly $this->request

### Encapsulate the managers in the models : 
* The parameter call in the construct of each model can now be null
* There are 3 methods in the modelAbstract to drive the managers(delete, read (io load), readAll (io getCollection))
* Update of the method loadByEmail in Admin & User from static to public


## new structure of model files and folders + update namespaces : 
* Deleting of the classes and models folder
* Updating of the namespaces

### Implementing of the view in the MVC structure :
* Creation of the View class
* This class generates the view and load the layout file
* The view class loads also the good specific content in the layout file
* Each specific content is created in the specific file
