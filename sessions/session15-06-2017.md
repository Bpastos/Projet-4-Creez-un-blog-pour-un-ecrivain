# TODO :

## Some modifications of the previous session: 
* For the tables User and Admin, Add an index unique for the email column
* Delete the functions checkName and checkEmail in User and Admin classes
* Change the name of the column 'name' by 'pseudo'
* Delete the attribut req of the classes Manager and replace them by a simple variable


## manager admin / user : 
* Refactor method read
* Modify method read(int $id) : 
	* One method read(int $id)
	* One method readByEmail($email)

* Add a third method protected loadByQuery($req)


## To refactor the managers: 
* Create class ManagerAbstract, mother of each Manager
* All the methods create / read / update / delete / count / etc must be create in the parent Class
* The daughter classes content an attribute $tableName which contains the name of the tables of the database

### Comments : 
* Creation of function returnData in ModelAbstract in order to get back all the attributes and to send them in an array. The goal is to avoid to set the attributes in public.
* Creation of the function convertData which delete the last lign of the array which is the name of the manager and not useful for the sql request
* The functions Modify and Create use the previous array in order to create a string which will be concatenated in the sql request


## To refactor the models : 
* All the models are the children of the ModelAbstract class.
* The ModelAbstract class contains the methods delete and save
* This class has an attribute $manager which refer to the good manager
* This->manager is initialized in the __construct of each model

### Comments :
* Creation of the function returnData useful for the refacotring of the managers
* Implemation of the function hydrate in the ModelAbstract
* Method loadByEmail has been implemented in static in admin and user classes because I cannot create a new instance of Admin or User without add an array in parameter.
* This method must be create a new instance of his manager -> For me this solution is not good. This subject will be discussed during the next meeting

## Rooter : 
* Use only one function Dispatch in the router which checks if controller and action(method) exist

## To chain calls : 
* In every object, in every methods which return nothing, we have to return the current object with $this

### Comments : 
* Implementation only in the methods which return nothing so only for the setters
* But I cannot use them because I use hydrate function to set the attributes

## Namespace : 
* Begin to learn how use the namespaces and to try to use them in the project

### Comments : 
* Each page or classe is able to run correctly with the implementation of namespaces
* Modification of the Autoloader :
	* Creation of new class Autoloader with two static functions : register and autoload
	* The function autoload has been updated
* Problem with the creation of new dynamic classes :
	* I have to use a var with the beginning of the namespaces in the functions readAll and loadByQuery in the ManagerAbstract
